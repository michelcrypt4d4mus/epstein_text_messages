Hi Jay — These four people were recommended. I have not contacted them to find out what their 
rates are. All are very active in the plaintiffs' bar in the West Palm area. Ted Babbitt would be 
my first choice of these four but I think he is conflicted out because one of his partners is 
married to an AUSA here. Stuart Grossman is probably my second choice.

Talk to Jack Goldberger about this group. They are all very good personal injury lawyers, but I 
have concerns about whether there would be an inherent tension because they may feel that 
THEY might make more money (and get a lot more press coverage) if they proceed outside the 
terms of the plea agreement. (Sorry — I just have a bias against plaintiffs' attorneys.) One nice 
thing about Bert is that he is in Miami where there has been almost no coverage of this case. 
Just so you know, I have never met Bert, but a good friend in our appellate section and one of the 
district judges in Miami are good friends with him and recommended him. 
Can you let me know tomorrow? I am going to be out for a while starting on Friday, and I 
would like to get this underway before I leave. 
Thank you.
