Hi Sue,
Regarding your first question: pursuant to Civil Rights Law§ 50-b, our office's practice in appellate sex
crimes matters is to file documents under seal. This is not particular to People v. Epstein; it is routine
across our appellate filings. My understanding is that it is also the Appellate Division's (the court's)
practice to maintain such seal.
That being said, I have discussed your second question with our attorneys. If the Post petitions the
court, and the court asks the People for our positon, we will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief.
Thanks.

Hi Dan,
Please explain why the DA's office didn't file a redacted brief, but rather covered up all the facts.
If we filed a petition for a redacted brief, would the DA's office fight it or cooperate?
Thank you,
Sue

Hi Sue - the document was filed under seal. I cannot violate the seal and provide it to you.
(off the record please) You may wish to petition the court, or have the Post's lawyer send our lawyers
something. We've reached the end of me being able to help - it's sealed.

Right, but the law allows for the redaction of victim names. Where does it say the whole document is
denied?

Hi Dan,
So it was a unilateral decision by the DA to seal the document?
There was no hearing or opportunity to object?
Thank you,

Thanks, Danny,
Is there a judge's order sealing this document?
Or is it just stated by the DA's office.
It's unclear on this cover page.

Hi Danny,
Thanks. Can you send me a PDF of the cover page?
Who issued that order?
We always get such court documents -- with the names and ID of victims redacted.
The whole document is not withheld.

Hi Sue - I've confirmed that the brief is filed under seal. It contains the following header on the cover
page: "Pursuant to Civil Rights Law§ 50-b, the identities of the victims, who are the victims of sex
offenses, shall be confidential, and this document shall not be made available for public inspection."
Accordingly we must decline your request. Thanks.

Hi Danny,
Following up on the Epstein case:
Can you send me the DA's appellate brief in the sex-offender registry case?
I understand you may have to redact the names of any victims.
Please let me know as soon as possible.
Thank you,
Sue
