Subject: Meeting 
Barry is available Monday morning. Our most flexible West Palm Beach magistrate is on duty 
on Monday, so, assuming we have signed documents by 1:30 or so, we should be able to get Mr. 
Epstein arraigned on Monday. I doubt that we will be able to get everything finished up here, 
get down to Miami, and try to find a Miami mag by close of business on Monday.

Subject RE: Revised agreement 
1 is definitely under 18 still, and I think there is a second minor. The appointment of ififfl 
ad !item is to provide you with a mechanism to make contact with the girls and to give 
them the assistance of an independent attorney who represents them (as opposed to me, who 
represents the government). If you are willing to provide the girls with independent counsel, at 
Mr. Epstein's expense (and I get to pick the attorney), that is alright with me.

Hi Jay - Can you look at this? Especially paragraph 7. I think this covers the exclusive 
remedy concern you had.
