# I Made Epstein's Text Messages Great Again

* The Epstein text messages (and some of the emails along with summary counts of sent emails to/from Epstein) generated by this code can be viewed [here](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/epstein_text_messages/).
* [I Made Epstein's Text Messages Great Again (And You Should Read Them)](https://cryptadamus.substack.com/p/i-made-epsteins-text-messages-great) post on [Substack](https://cryptadamus.substack.com/p/i-made-epsteins-text-messages-great)
* Configuration variables assigning specific `HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_XXXXXX.txt` file IDs (the `111111` part) as being emails to or from particular people based on various research and contributions can be found in the [constants.py](./util/constants.py) file in this repo.

Requires you have a local copy of OCR text from the House Oversight document dump in a directory `/path/to/epstein/ocr_txt_files`.  Then you can run with:

```bash
DOCS_DIR=/path/to/epstein/ocr_txt_files ./epstein_chat_logs_reformatter
```

Run `./epstein_chat_logs_reformatter.py --help` for command line option assistance.
