# I Made Epstein's Text Messages Great Again

* [I Made Epstein's Text Messages Great Again (And You Should Read Them)](https://cryptadamus.substack.com/p/i-made-epsteins-text-messages-great) post on [Substack](https://cryptadamus.substack.com/p/i-made-epsteins-text-messages-great)
* The Epstein text messages (and some of the emails along with summary information) generated by this code can be viewed [here](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/epstein_text_messages/).
* All of His Emails along with descriptions of the 496 files that were neither emails nor text messages can be read at [another page also generated by this code](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/epstein_text_messages/all_emails_epstein_files_nov_2025.html).
* Word counts for the communications are [here](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/epstein_text_messages/communication_word_count_epstein_files_nov_2025.html).
* Metadata containing what I have figured out about who sent or received the communications in a given file (and a brief explanation for how I figured it out for each file) is deployed [here](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/epstein_text_messages/file_metadata_epstein_files_nov_2025.json)
* Configuration variables assigning specific `HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_XXXXXX.txt` file IDs (the `111111` part) as being emails to or from particular people based on various research and contributions can be found in [constants.py](./epstein_files/util/constants.py). Everything in `constants.py` appears in the JSON metadata linked above.


## Usage
1. Requires you have a local copy of OCR text from the House Oversight document dump in a directory `/path/to/epstein/ocr_txt_files`. You can download them from [the Congressional Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ldncvdqIf6miiskDp_EDuGSDAaI_fJx8).
1. Dependencies are in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml). Use `poetry install` for easiest time installing. `pip install epstein-files` should also work, though `pipx install epstein-files` is usually better.

You need to set the `EPSTEIN_DOCS_DIR` environment variable with the path to the folder of files you just downloaded when running. You can either create a `.env` file modeled on [`.env.example`](./.env.example) (which will set it permanently) or you can run with:

```bash
EPSTEIN_DOCS_DIR=/path/to/epstein/ocr_txt_files epstein_generate --help
```

All the tools that come with the package require `EPSTEIN_DOCS_DIR` to be set. These are the available tools:

```bash
# Generate color highlighted texts/emails/other files
epstein_generate

# Search for a string:
epstein_search Bannon
# Or a regex:
epstein_search '\bSteve\s*Bannon\b'

# Show a color highlighted file:
epstein_show 030999
# Show both the highlighted and raw versions of the file:
epstein_show --raw 030999
# This also works:
epstein_show HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030999

# Diff two epstein files after all the cleanup (stripping BOMs, matching newline chars, etc):
epstein_diff 030999 020442
```

Run `epstein_generate --help` for command line option assistance.

The first time you run anything it will take a few minutes to fix all the data, attribute the redacted emails, etc. Once you've run things once you can run the `epstein_generate --pickled` to load the cached data and things will be very quick.

#### As A Library
```python
from epstein_files.epstein_files import EpsteinFiles
epstein_files = EpsteinFiles.get_files(use_pickled=True)

# All files
for document in epstein_files.all_documents():
    do_stuff(document)

# Emails
for email in epstein_files.emails:
    do_stuff(email)

# iMessage Logs
for imessage_log in epstein_files.imessage_logs:
    do_stuff(imessage_log)

# Other Files
for file in epstein_files.other_files:
    do_stuff(file)
```
