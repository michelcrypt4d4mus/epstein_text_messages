* [I Made Epstein's Text Messages Great Again (And You Should Read Them)](https://cryptadamus.substack.com/p/i-made-epsteins-text-messages-great) post on [Substack](https://cryptadamus.substack.com/p/i-made-epsteins-text-messages-great)
* The Epstein text messages (and some of the emails along with summary counts of sent emails to/from Epstein) generated by this code can be viewed [here](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/epstein_text_messages/).
* All of His Emails can be read at another page also generated by this code [here](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/epstein_emails_house_oversight/).
* Word counts for the emails and text messages are [here](https://michelcrypt4d4mus.github.io/epstein_text_messages/epstein_emails_word_count.html).
* Configuration variables assigning specific `HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_XXXXXX.txt` file IDs (the `111111` part) as being emails to or from particular people based on various research and contributions can be found in the [constants.py](./epstein_files/util/constants.py) file in this repo.


### Usage
Dependencies are in [pyproject.toml](./pyproject.toml). Use `poetry install` for easiest time installing. `pip install .` may or may not work.

Requires you have a local copy of OCR text from the House Oversight document dump in a directory `/path/to/epstein/ocr_txt_files`.  Then you can run with:

```bash
DOCS_DIR=/path/to/epstein/ocr_txt_files ./generate.py
```

Run `./generate.py --help` for command line option assistance. Look in the [scripts](./scripts/) folder for various scripts.

#### As A Library
```python
from epstein_files.epstein_files import EpsteinFiles
epstein_files = EpsteinFiles.get_files()

# All files
